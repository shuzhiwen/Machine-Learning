### Deep Learning
* Some [examples]('./deep-learning/example') for keras and tensorflow
* Useful [materials]('./deep-learning/materials') for learning deep learning
### Machine learning
> An [example]('./traincascade') of testing school badge using opencv_traincascade
1. [sample.py]('./traincascade/sample.py') makeing some positive samples using affine transformation
2. [resize.py]('./traincascade/resize.py') reducing samples to a size that opencv is suitable for processing
3. [describe.py]('./traincascade/describe.py') generating description file for samples
4. [opencv_traincascade]('./traincascade/opencv_traincascade') training model
5. [test.cpp]('./traincascade/test.cpp') using the model to detect new samples
